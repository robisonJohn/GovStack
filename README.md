# Title
GovStack

# Description
<p>
A fundamental component of blockchain technology is decentralization; rather than several major technology companies holding massive troves of user data within walled
gardens, blockchain technology seeks to put data ownership back in the hands of the users. Additionally, blockchain technology seeks to build decentralized business models
that rely extensively on the input of their stakeholders to help guide the product's direction. This is called governance, i.e. the way in which users interact with a company
to reach consensus on certain decisions and chart a path forward. This is seen as the optimal way to practice corporate stewardship moving forward. However, the problem is that
governance models are seldom clear or easy to find. This opacity of governance is at best an oxymoron and at worst a severe hindrance to blockchain's progression as a 
socio-cultural and economic movement towards decentralized power distribution. In short, the accessibility of governance data is paramount to the success of the blockchain 
industry.

<p>
Enter GovStack, a database that seeks to aggregate governance data in a reliable, systematic way by relying on crowdsourcing community input. On GovStack, users can 
look up information relating to a specific crypto currency's governance model; if the data is either incorrect, partially missing, or fully missing, users can edit this
information. By adding information to the site, the user can earn TrustTokens, a reputation-based system designed to reward users who offer helpful input to the 
system.
